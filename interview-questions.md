# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming refers to a programming style that focuses on programming around objects consisting of key:value pairs. Functional programming refers to the utilization of programming with functions. Ruby is a OOP language, whereas JavaScript is a functional programming language.

Researched answer: OOP is a programming paradigm that was initially created to handle larger complex software systems. Objects act as containers that store and separate sections of code that handle specific procedures. This allows code to be more easily "blocked-off" from the code as a whole, and allow for quicker fixes and less unexpected change from any alterations within the code. 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are built by constructing and implementing programs to acheive the desired output. The ultimate goal of this is clean iteritable code with "mathematics" style functions to solve the problem.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:An integer is any whole number, ie (1, 2, 3..) whereas a float is a decimal number, ie (1.3, 4.3, 6.5) When using integers for mathematical expressions, the return will be a whole number integer. For float however, it will return as a float value. Only one value within a mathematical expression needs to be a float value for the return to also be a float. 

Researched answer: If a non-whole number is the desired return, then a float must be passed into the initial equation.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means that there is no need for a return statement, or in the case of Ruby, a puts statement within a function. Once the function has been initially declared, Ruby then automatically assumes that a return is expected and will output that.

Researched answer: In Ruby, if a return is the last expression in a path of execution, there's no need for a return keyword. Since Ruby reads from top to bottom, it already has the logic built in to expect that last statement to be a return.
